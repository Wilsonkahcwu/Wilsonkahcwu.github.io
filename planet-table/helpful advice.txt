If you are having trouble with making the Jovian Plantes row with the gas giants 
look at the HTML table Basic link (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) 
and look at the rowspan, and scrope. Then go to the HTML table advanced features and accessibility (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Advanced)
and look at rowgroup, and row and it will explain it further, let me know if this made sense or if you need help.
